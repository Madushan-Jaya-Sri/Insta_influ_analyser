# Brand Assets

Place brand logo files in this directory:

- `momentro-logo.png` - Used with hyphen format
- `momentro_logo.png` - Used with underscore format

Both naming formats are required by the application to ensure proper display of the logo in all contexts.

The deployment script will automatically create placeholder logos if real ones don't exist.
