Most of the time there is an image to salvage, however, all of the time, the adventures to these landscapes make up for the occasional disappointment. \n\nIn this video, I set up and retrieve a recent shot aimed at situating wildlife against a recognisable mountainscape.

For those of you who have been following along - we found them! \n\nTwo healthy little cubs roughly 8 months old are now roaming around with their mother as she teaches them how to navigate this tricky environment against the iconic backdrop of the Sri Pada mountainscape; each species in this image fair game (except me), as the cubs learn the ways of an apex predator.\n\nThis image was made by combining 7 images taken over a period of 6 weeks. The species seen here include the Black-naped hare, Rusty-spotted cat, Indian crested porcupine, Ring-tailed civet, and Sri Lankan leopard. \n\nFollow along to see footage of those cubs, soon!\n\n#yaniktissera #parrotfishcollective",

What was I doing trying to tick off a previsualised shot at the wrong month of the year? \n\nI was aware of the opportunities to capture iconic images in the highlands - ones that are unique and showcase the co-existence of humans and leopards in the central highlands of Sri Lanka, despite the issue of snaring. Whilst humans navigate these landscapes during the day, the islands\u2019 terrestrial apex predators comfortably traverse the same paths after dark. \n\nI may not have captured the perfect image, but I am glad to have ticked off one from my growing list of images that will help tell this story. No doubt it is particularly rewarding considering what a beautifully clear night it was when this individual decided to come by, and despite all the odds, I am proud to have made an image of a Leopard with the Sri Pada mountainscape alight as the backdrop.\n\n#yaniktissera #parrotfishcollective",

Here, Arnold appears on a full-moon night striding out of his daytime safe space of the nearby Peak Wilderness Sanctuary. Moonlight pours over the side of the cliff, illuminating his powerful stride as he begins his patrol into his shared territory with humans. \n\nAs apex predators, leopards play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of our ecosystems here on the island, ensuring the health and diversity of wildlife surrounding us, whether that\u2019s inside or outside of Protected Areas.\n\nHowever, with increasing threats from habitat destruction, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict, this national treasure needs our utmost care and protection now more than ever. Conservation efforts are vital to safeguard their future and the rich biodiversity they represent.\n\nThrough our work, we aim to shine a light on these enigmatic animals, raising awareness and fostering a spirit of coexistence between leopards and the communities that share their spaces. Together, we can create a future where these beautiful creatures roam freely in our jungles and in close proximity to humans, all the while, inspiring generations to respect and protect our natural heritage.\n\n#yaniktissera #parrotfishcollective",

        "all_captions": "Every four to six weeks, we return to the cameras high up in the mountains to check what images may have been made. At times, we get unlucky; equipment malfunctions, adverse weather, dead batteries, curious monkeys, and ravenous ants are just a few of the persistent troubles to be dealt with. Most of the time there is an image to salvage, however, all of the time, the adventures to these landscapes make up for the occasional disappointment. \n\nIn this video, I set up and retrieve a recent shot aimed at situating wildlife against a recognisable mountainscape. There is never a shortage of surprises as various creatures and beautiful landscapes present themselves anew at every visit. \n\nWatch till the end for a sneak peek of some results!\n\n#yaniktissera #parrotfishcollective\n\nWith the last remaining sub-montane and montane rainforests and one of the world\u2019s richest concentrations of biodiversity that include an extremely high number of endemic species (many of which are site-endemic), the Central Highlands of Sri Lanka are truly a special place and as such represented in the UNESCO World Heritage List. \n\nDuring the drier months of the year (January - March), Sri Lanka\u2019s mountain region is at high risk of fires. Determined by low humidity, topography and wind patterns during the short fire season of the wet zone, fires pose a danger to the mountain regions that are already vulnerable to climate change and environmental degradation. \n\nIt is the Eucalyptus, pine forests and grasslands that are especially prone, with many of these trees located on (inaccessible) steep slopes adjacent to tea estates, and the forest patches that are of significant importance. \n\nEven though the Central and Uva provinces are classified as having a \u201clow fire risk\u201d, raging fires and plumes of smoke rising from the sides of cliff faces are a common occurrence during the drier periods, always threatening pristine wilderness spaces close by. \n\nPictured here, a waterfall cascades into the Maussakelle reservoir as a wildfire burns at the bottom of a tea estate, sending clouds of smoke into the air against the backdrop of Sri Pada and the Peak Wilderness Sanctuary in the distance. \n\n#yaniktissera\n\nA self-portrait with a few visitors at our last location - these types of images are always a bonus for me if the particular photograph that was envisioned doesn\u2019t work out. (It did). \n\nAs the camera records multiple moments over time, we are able to creatively piece together a surreal image, showcasing shared spaces of numerous species. \n\nWhat\u2019s particularly special about this one is the little Leopard on the left. He/She is one of Arnold\u2019s cubs. For those of you who have been following along - we found them! \n\nTwo healthy little cubs roughly 8 months old are now roaming around with their mother as she teaches them how to navigate this tricky environment against the iconic backdrop of the Sri Pada mountainscape; each species in this image fair game (except me), as the cubs learn the ways of an apex predator.\n\nThis image was made by combining 7 images taken over a period of 6 weeks. The species seen here include the Black-naped hare, Rusty-spotted cat, Indian crested porcupine, Ring-tailed civet, and Sri Lankan leopard. \n\nFollow along to see footage of those cubs, soon!\n\n#yaniktissera #parrotfishcollective\n\nMountainscapes in silver.\n\nSunlight pierces through a gentle fog early one morning in the mountains of Sri Lanka. First light illuminates tea slopes whilst townships stir quietly in the shadow of the valleys. \n\n#yaniktissera\n\nA sacred mountain \nLit at its peak\nAwaiting pilgrims\nAnswers they seek\n\nA journey made\nTo concur terrain\nSpiritual growth\nOne seeks to attain \n\nA sacred footprint \nLeft after dark \nOut of sight \nI leave my mark\n\nDays before Sri Pada (Adams Peak) was declared open for the season, a leopard strolled past my camera. There was an error in my understanding - the mountain weather only becomes favourable after the full moon of December (which also marks the opening of the Sri Pada season). What was I doing trying to tick off a previsualised shot at the wrong month of the year? \n\nI was aware of the opportunities to capture iconic images in the highlands - ones that are unique and showcase the co-existence of humans and leopards in the central highlands of Sri Lanka, despite the issue of snaring. Whilst humans navigate these landscapes during the day, the islands\u2019 terrestrial apex predators comfortably traverse the same paths after dark. \n\nI may not have captured the perfect image, but I am glad to have ticked off one from my growing list of images that will help tell this story. No doubt it is particularly rewarding considering what a beautifully clear night it was when this individual decided to come by, and despite all the odds, I am proud to have made an image of a Leopard with the Sri Pada mountainscape alight as the backdrop.\n\n#yaniktissera #parrotfishcollective\n\nWhat better day than \u2018International Leopard Day\u2019 to share one of my favourite photographs so far from my Central Highlands project?  We are in our second year of documenting the life of this resident Male, Arnold (@wwctsrilanka ) and his exploits in a remote corner of Sri Lanka\u2019s mountain ranges. Here, Arnold appears on a full-moon night striding out of his daytime safe space of the nearby Peak Wilderness Sanctuary. Moonlight pours over the side of the cliff, illuminating his powerful stride as he begins his patrol into his shared territory with humans. \n\nAs apex predators, leopards play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of our ecosystems here on the island, ensuring the health and diversity of wildlife surrounding us, whether that\u2019s inside or outside of Protected Areas.\n\nHowever, with increasing threats from habitat destruction, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict, this national treasure needs our utmost care and protection now more than ever. Conservation efforts are vital to safeguard their future and the rich biodiversity they represent.\n\nThrough our work, we aim to shine a light on these enigmatic animals, raising awareness and fostering a spirit of coexistence between leopards and the communities that share their spaces. Together, we can create a future where these beautiful creatures roam freely in our jungles and in close proximity to humans, all the while, inspiring generations to respect and protect our natural heritage.\n\n#yaniktissera #parrotfishcollective\n\nIt\u2019s almost that time of year again to head back to some of my favourite parts of the island and I couldn\u2019t help but share perhaps what I am most looking forward to.\n\nPictured here is a mating pair (Arnold) amid the tea fields of the Central Highlands, performing their courting rituals, centre frame. Not only is this an extremely lucky image, (as they have a whole mountain to choose from to perform this exchange) but it is also especially exciting as there could now be cubs roaming these particular tea slopes.\n\nThis image was taken earlier this year in March - assuming a successful pairing and with a gestation period of roughly 3 months, (and with a little more luck) we may be able to document this next generation, further recording Arnold\u2019s success story as he fathers offspring outside of a Protected Area and in a human-dominated landscape! \n\nStay tuned for updates. #yaniktissera\n\nThanks to the epic team that accompany me on these field visits. Not only does it add so much colour having a crew with me, but the additional wo(man) power definitely goes a long way with scouting, setting up, maintenance, filming and general positive vibrations - especially when things don\u2019t go according to plan. Watch till the end to see some results from the month of December! \n\nBig thanks always for all the hard work and encouragement - Ganesh, Kiruba, Subramani, achchi, @mikatennekoon @yhevintissera @aitanaa_g @justmclovin @crimpysnitch @tavishgunasena and Akira.\n\n#yaniktissera #parrotfishcollective\n\nWe were so delighted when we checked the cameras this February and finally had confirmation that Arnolds late-night rendezvous was indeed a success.
